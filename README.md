# What this project is
Hello anyone who happens to see this! This "project" is meant to be a really quick repository for me so that
when I get some new device I can have it up and mining in 5 minutes; and I know that others may find these useful
as well.

I want to make perfectly clear, I did not write the code for these, I am using `xmrig` at the moment. I did make slight
modifications to the source code regarding `donations` and the hash rate output, but otherwise the code is the same.

**UPDATE:**
I added a 15% donation level now, but only to the 64 bit binary. If you are not about that you can use the
binary from this commit `9411123fcb3456c06343b4c9ab3bc52d1833b089`.

I recognize what a dick move this is, in multiple regards, but if you are knowledgeable about how to use git
or just adventurous this should be a minor obstacle.

# Getting started
First you need to find out what kind of processor your phone has. Google `<phone> cpu specs` and you should be able to
see shat kind of processor your phone is using. If it says something along the lines of "32 bit" then you should go to
the `android_arm86` folder and follow the instructions. If it says something along the lines of "64 bit" then you are
looking for the `android_arm64` folder. If your phone uses an Intel processor you should go to the `android_i686` folder.

# What coins this can mine
I have personally tested these miners with Monero (XMR) and Electorneum (ETN), but I am to understand that they whould also work
with Aeon and Sumokoin.

# Issues
Be sure to let me know if you have any issues getting this to work. I want to have this work for everyone!
